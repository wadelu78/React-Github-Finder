# Github Finder

An react app which grabs and displays data from some Github endpoints.

A thorough learning and recap process from the Udemy online course:

"React Front To Back"

We can search registered users from the github

And display the user detail

The project is reconstructed by using modern REACT features such as hooks.

Then it is deployed on Netlify.
